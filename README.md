# Mitesh Shah's Personal Blog

Hey there, this is my personal blog setup using Hugo Static Site Generator with the PaperCSS theme

To add posts to this blog, just add your posts in `content` -> `posts` -> `title` with the appropriate metadata. This repo also has a CI built in it which builds and deploys the blog to http://mitesh1612.github.io/blog
