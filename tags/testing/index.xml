As a developer working for a mature codebase, the most common tests that you will need to write are Unit Tests, and its a good practice tbh.
While working on my team&amp;rsquo;s project (which was in a fairly early stage), I saw various kinds of Unit Tests and researched a bit myself on how to write some good UTs. Today I plan to share the same in this post.</description></item><item><title>A Primer on Different Kinds of Tests</title><link>https://mitesh1612.github.io/posts/primer-on-tests/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mitesh1612.github.io/posts/primer-on-tests/</guid><description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been a developer for too long (yet) to justify or even explain the importance of well written tests, especially in your CI system, but over my experience in recent times, I have seen great tests helping me catch a lot of future headaches. That being said, while developing a service end-to-end, I got to see the different kinds of tests and testing strategies and I thought why not &amp;ldquo;blog my journey&amp;rdquo; on testing.</description></item></channel></rss>
