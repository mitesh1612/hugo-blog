I finally took the leap and set up my blog, and after a lot of thinking, I finally decided to create a blog.
Why a blog? Well among a lot of other reasons, like not forgetting what I learn from time to time, and to keep track of my journey as a Software Development Engineer. The other huge reason is that I love to learn new things, research the ones I find interesting, and I plan to document and share my learnings via blog posts, which can be easily found and referred to later as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
